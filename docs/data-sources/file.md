# toml_file (Data Source)

The `toml_file` data source allows Terraform to parse TOML file content as a data source.

Note that the content is returned in `content_json` as a JSON-encoded string. You can then use the `jsondecode()` function to access fields within the TOML file. This oddity is due to a current limitation in the Terraform Plugin Framework.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "toml_file" "example" {
  input = file("${path.module}/example.toml")
}

output "toml_file_content" {
  value = jsondecode(data.toml_file.example.content_json)
}
```
